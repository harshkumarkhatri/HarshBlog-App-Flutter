# Harsh Blog App Flutter

This is an app which i created for my blog:- harshblog.xyz .I was inspired by a similar app created by one of my friend for his blog so i decided to made one.I am still learning flutter so i have taken help from certain sources when i was unable to overcome an error all by myself.
<br>
**About the App**<BR>
In this app there are three sections in the footer of the app through which you can access three different screens of the app which are as follows:-
* Blogs:- Where you can access and read al the blogs which are provided on my blog site.
* About:- With the help of this section you can find the details about me and how you can contact me.
* Youtube:- This section has the videos, the subscriber count, channel name and channel DP and you could access my channel videos directly from here.You can also watch videos directly from the player inside and no need to open youtube app for this.

<br>Talking about the sections, i have implemented the first two by myself and for the third one i have taken inspiration from https://github.com/MarcusNg/flutter_youtube_api and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feQhHStBVLE as i was completely unaware about the youtube API.
<br>
I am also thinking of adding a push notification system through which users can be made aware about new video/blogs being posted.
<br>
Things which are done in this app involve:
* MaterialApp class/design.
* Scaffold Class.
* AppBar.
* Use of functions and variables.
* Stateless and Stateful widget.
* Api call.
* Displaying JSON output in good form.
* Youtube Player
* Bottom navigation bar etc.

___
Built using 
* Flutter

Some snaps from the app and the full video will be updated soon in this.<br>
If you want to run the app for your self, you can clone the repo and run the command given below.
```
flutter run
```
If you want to customize the app for yourself, you can replace the following links.
* Blog link in main.dart file.
* About link in about_me.dart file.

<br>
Also create a new directory in lib folder with the name utilities and have a keys.dart file which will be having a key from the youtube API.
